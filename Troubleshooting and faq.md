<Br><strong>1) Why is my app showing application error upon clicking open
app?</strong> <Br>

-   The possible error can be within your mongo_URI, cross check if you've
    written the correct password in the secret string defined on your config
    vars.</li>
-   Added to that there's possibility that your URi isn't giving ip access, in
    such cases, go to your cluster's setting and check the <strong>'network
    access' tab</strong>, and open your cluster's ip. If the given ip isn't
    public then do it but clicking on "allow access from anywhere" option on the
    dialogue box If you've done it then refreshing your heroku's page shall fix
    the problem.</li>
-   Another error can be "no web processes running". Well this is a very simple
    error that might have been accidentally caused. If we explain what's it then
    the fact is, on heroku there's a option called "web npm start" which starts
    the web processes to launch your application. When it's turned off, this
    error surfaces. You can simply re enable it by clicking on the configure
    dynos option and then hitting the on button.

<Br><strong>2)What is Error R15: Memory quota exceeded?</strong>

-   Well so this error is something one may get several days after they're
    constantly running their application for days or weeks. To explain in terms
    of technical, this error surfaces when your bot stacks up with too much of
    cache and no space is left for functioning properly. To fix this error all
    you've to do in case of heroku is just to do is to click on <strong> Restart
    all dynos</strong> option. After a few seconds or minutes (depending on your
    network speed) you'll find the logs saying "app all ready to go". Your
    error"s fixed :v

<Br><Strong>3)Why I can't verify my SESSION_ID?</strong>

-   There's a minor reasons that your app is throwing this error while
    verification of qr. The most common is that you're typing the wrong id?
    Cross check the spelling of your specified session and try again.

<Br><strong>3)How can i fix "Qr code isn't generated yet" error?</strong>

-   The reason is that your qr session has expired after verifying it
    previously. The only way to fix this minor error would be to change your
    session id on config vars and then open the app and scan the freshly
    generated qr to launch it.

<Br><strong>4)How can i fix "cannot get client/qr" error</strong>

-   Simply refresh your page to get the qr code or it's already verified then
    the message "you're already authenticated" :v

<Br><strong>5) Why i can't scan my qr for connecting?</strong>

-   This error can surface either when Baileys library has updated or WhatsApp
    web is, for fixation you gotta re deploy your app from heroku.
